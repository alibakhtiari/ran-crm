# ✅ RAN CRM - Build Fixed & Sync Implemented!

## 🎉 SUCCESS!

Your Flutter app now **builds successfully** and has **automatic sync functionality**!

```
✓ Built build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk (24.3s)
```

## What Was Fixed

### Build Issue ❌ → ✅
- **Problem**: workmanager 0.5.2 incompatible with Flutter 3.35.6
- **Solution**: Removed workmanager, implemented alternative sync
- **Result**: App builds without errors!

### Sync Implementation ✅
- **Auto-sync**: Runs when app opens (if 1+ hours passed)
- **Manual sync**: Available in Settings, Contacts, and Call Logs screens
- **Two-way sync**: Contacts sync between phone and server
- **Call logs**: Upload to server automatically

## How It Works

### Automatic Sync
```
User Opens App
   ↓
Check: Has it been 1+ hour since last sync?
   ↓ Yes
Sync Contacts & Call Logs Silently
   ↓
Refresh UI with New Data
   ↓
Done! User sees updated data
```

### Manual Sync (Anytime)
- **Settings Screen**: "Sync Now" button
- **Contacts Screen**: Menu → "Sync Phone Data"
- **Call Logs Screen**: Sync icon button
