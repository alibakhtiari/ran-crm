## üìä What Gets Synced

### Contacts
- **From Phone ‚Üí  Server**:
  - All contacts with phone numbers
  - Contact name
  - Primary phone number
  - Skips contacts without phone numbers
  - Skips duplicates (same phone number)

- **From Server ‚Üí Phone**:
  - All CRM contacts
  - Creates new phone contacts
  - Skips if contact already exists

### Call Logs
- **From Phone ‚Üí Server**:
  - Last 30 days of call history
  - Incoming calls
  - Outgoing calls
  - Call duration (seconds)
  - Timestamp
  - Automatically links to existing contacts

---

## üîÑ Sync Behavior

### First Sync
- Uploads all your phone contacts to CRM
- Uploads last 30 days of call logs
- May take 1-2 minutes depending on data

### Subsequent Syncs
- Only new/changed data is uploaded
- Duplicates are automatically skipped
- Much faster than first sync

### Cross-Device Sync
1. **Device A** syncs contacts ‚Üí Server
2. **Device B** syncs from Server ‚Üí Phone
3. Now both devices have the same contacts!

---

## üì± Example Workflow

### Scenario: Team with 3 phones

**Phone 1 (Admin)**:
- Has 100 contacts
- Syncs ‚Üí All 100 go to server
- Everyone can now see them

**Phone 2 (User)**:
- Has 50 contacts (30 are new)
- Syncs ‚Üí 30 new contacts go to server
- Receives 100 contacts from Phone 1

**Phone 3 (User)**:
- Has no contacts
- Syncs ‚Üí Receives all 130 unique contacts

**Result**: All 3 phones now have the same 130 contacts!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Data is stored securely on Cloudflare
- Call logs include phone numbers, not recordings

### Data Usage
