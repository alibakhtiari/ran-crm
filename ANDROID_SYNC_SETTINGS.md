    account,
    AUTHORITY,
    Bundle.EMPTY,
    3600L  // Every 1 hour (in seconds)
)
```

### Sync Adapter Settings
```xml
<!-- sync_adapter.xml -->
<sync-adapter
    android:contentAuthority="com.crm.ran_crm.provider"
    android:accountType="com.crm.ran_crm"
    android:userVisible="true"           ← Shows in Settings

## Sync Intervals

You can adjust the sync interval by modifying `MainActivity.kt` line 93:

```kotlin
// Current: Every 1 hour
ContentResolver.addPeriodicSync(account, AUTHORITY, Bundle.EMPTY, 3600L)

// Every 30 minutes
ContentResolver.addPeriodicSync(account, AUTHORITY, Bundle.EMPTY, 1800L)

// Every 15 minutes
